Thank you for installing my Reshade Preset.


[Requirements] 

A computer with Windows 7 SP1, 8.1 or 10 and .NET Framework 4.5 or higher installed is required.


[Directions - Installing Reshade]

WARNING! DO NOT INSTALL WITH THE GAME OPEN! 

1 - Run "ReShade_Setup_5.5.2.exe" in the file.

2 - Select "Click here to manage a game and it's Installation".

3 - In the list, find and select your Garry's Mod laucher (Usually hl2.exe with the Garry's Mod logo beside it. But if you are using the 64 bit Chromium branch, use the "gmod.exe" which located in "Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\bin\win64\").

4 - Select "Direct3D 9" if it asks what rendering API it uses.

5 - Select ALL the effect packs, then click "OK".

6 - Click "OK" when it shows you each effect pack's effects, make sure all of these effects are checked, sometimes it doesn't check them all on it's own.

7 - Once done with step 6, ReShade should be installed on your Garry's Mod.


[Directions - Setting up Reshade]

1 - Copy the preset "Spr_Aachen's Reshade Prest for Garry's Mod.ini" to "Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\bin\" (Or "Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\bin\win64\" if you're using the 64 bit Chromium branch).

2 - Press the HOME button or "HOME" on your keyboard to open the menu.

3 - Once open, click the drop-down menu towards the top of the Reshade menu, find and select a .ini file to use the preset you want.

4 - After that, click on "Add-ons" tab at the top bar of the Reshade menu. Enable "Copy depth buffer before ...", this allows effects like MXAO, PPFX SSDO, and RTGI to function in-game. (REQUIRED FOR AO/RTGI TO WORK!)

5 - Go into your Garry's Mod in-game graphics settings (Main menu - Options - Video -  Advanced). Click the drop-down menu under "Antialiasing Mode" and select "None". (REQUIRED FOR AO/RTGI TO WORK!)

6 - After that, Reshade should now be fully functional and effective in your game.


[FAQ]

- When I press home my Reshade won't open? Make sure it's installed properly, use a virtual keyboard if needed.

- How do I uninstall Reshade? Run the Reshade.exe again, select your hl2/gmod.exe, and uninstall.

- Where do I get the RTGI effect? You need to pay for it, look up "Pascal Glitcher" for more info.

- I can't find my hl2/gmod.exe? Make sure you are looking in the right file path & drive.

- Why is my game so bright? Enable HDR.

- Why am I having this visual bug? Some effects in Reshade are very buggy, this is to be expected.
